    <h2>What information do you collect?</h2>

    This application collects various information when you interact with it.
    This information includes automatically collected usage information such as
    HTTP request logs, Dialogflow API functionality, and user identifiers,
    including your Google ID. If you choose to place an order, you will be
    prompted for transaction details. This information will be held by Google
    using Google Pay, and will only be transmitted in tokenized format to the
    Square testing API.

    <h2>How do you use the information?</h2>

    This information is used only for demo purposes. In the demo, you are able
    to place orders and check the status of your order. This should never send
    email or contact you outside the demo environment.

    <h2>What information do you share?</h2>

    Submitted credit card information for a transaction is handled via Google
    Pay and the Square TESTING infrastructure, and no cards should be charged.
    Information is also shared with Google through their Dialogflow and Actions
    on Google service, but your information will not be shared with other
    companies except as outlined above.
